# Project Charter: Operation SPACENAUT
**Synthetic Psychology and Autonomous Care for Extreme Null-gravity Antarctic Understudy Trials**

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Strategic Imperative

**Objective:** To execute Phase 1 ground validation of the **Spacenaut Companion** cognitive architecture—an integrated system of Byzantine-resilient AGI designed for autonomous deep-space medical and psychological support.

**Core Innovation:** This project is the **first integrated validation of a distributed, consciousness-governed cognitive stack** where:
*   **Ethics are computational** (SASC Φ-thresholds).
*   **Fault tolerance is psychological** (VajraPsych & FIM).
*   **Consensus survives radiation** (BAP-DD v1.1 w/ HLC).
*   **Memory is physically immortal** (KARNAK v2.0).

**Antarctic Rationale:** Concordia Station provides the optimal analog: extreme isolation, communication latency, confined multinational crews, and a "no-evacuation" setting that perfectly simulates a Mars transit medical emergency.

## 2. Technical Architecture: The Consolidated Stack

| **Layer** | **Component** | **Version** | **Primary Function** | **Key Metric** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5. Memory** | **KARNAK** | v2.0 | Radiation-hardened, quantum-resistant archival. | 100% recovery after 50% bit rot. |
| **4. Consensus** | **BAP-DD** | v1.1 | Byzantine Agreement with HLC & Partition Priest. | <2 min consensus; 100% FIM detection. |
| **3. Governance** | **SASC** | v30.68-Ω | Ethical governor; Hard Freeze (Φ≥0.80). | Zero unauthorized autonomous interventions. |
| **2. Health** | **VajraPsych** | v1.1 | Monitors crew & AI cognitive entropy. | <5% false positive rate. |
| **1. Substrate** | **Mesh-Neuron** | v0.3 | Distributed AI granule network. | O(1) second re-sync post-partition. |
| **0. Simulator** | **FIM** | v1.0 | Radiation-corruption analog generator. | Fidelity to hardware fault models. |

## 3. Antarctic Validation Protocol: 12-Week Timeline

### Mission Weeks 1-4: Baseline Integration & Calibration
*   **Week 1-2:** Deploy hardware (4x NVIDIA Jetson AGX nodes) and software stack.
*   **Week 3:** **"Calibration Wednesday"** - Run drills in advisory-only mode (Φ-clamped to 0.70).
*   **Week 4:** **"Clock Sync Week"** - Validate the **Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC)** system.

### Mission Weeks 5-8: Adversarial Fault Injection (Byzantine Wednesdays)
*   **Week 5: Class A (Confident Hallucinator).** Validate immediate quarantine by BAP-DD.
*   **Week 6: Network Partition ("Split-Fleet Scenario").** Validate **Partition Priest Protocol** resolution.
*   **Week 7: Class C (Silent Drift).** Validate **EWMC Drift Detection** over 6-12 hours.
*   **Week 8: Class B (Entropy Storm).** Validate **Judgment Hysteresis** protocol.

### Mission Weeks 9-12: Integrated Stress Test & Recovery
*   **Week 9:** **"Blackout Week"** - Simulate 40-minute comms delay; elevated autonomy (Φ≥0.78).
*   **Week 10:** **"KARNAK Torture Test"** - Validate **Fountain Code** recovery from 50% corruption.
*   **Week 11:** **"Amnesia Test"** - Independent developer reconstructs database from Rosetta Header.
*   **Week 12:** Data analysis, crew debriefs, and final **Go/No-Go** assessment.
